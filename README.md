# Title:
 C++ code to demonstrate the implementation of a custom stack data structure named MyStack using the Standard Template Library (STL) stack container.

# Theory:
This C++ code showcases the implementation of a custom stack data structure, MyStack, using the STL stack container as a private member variable.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Define a custom stack data structure MyStack using the STL stack container. *Include methods for pushing, popping, retrieving the top element, checking for emptiness, and obtaining the stack size.
2)In the main function: *Create an instance of MyStack named myStack.
Push three values (10, 20, 30) onto the stack. *Display the top element and stack size. *Perform a pop operation and show the top element and stack size afterward. *Attempt additional pop operations, including popping from an empty stack. 3)The program is complete, demonstrating the usage of the custom stack data structure and handling empty stack conditions.

# Explanation of Code:
This C++ code demonstrates a custom stack data structure, `MyStack`, implemented using the STL stack container. It provides essential stack operations, such as push, pop, top, isEmpty, and size. The code creates an instance of `MyStack`, pushes values onto the stack, and performs various operations, including handling empty stack conditions by returning a sentinel value (-1) when necessary. It serves as a practical example of how to implement and use a stack with error handling.
